# Modelling the Impact of Geopolitical Tensions amidst the US-China Trade War on the Global Semiconductor Economy

In this project, a Simultion of the Global Semiconductor Supply Chain is Simulated on JaamSim. In modelling the impact of the tensions in the US-China Trade war, the project focuses on the event in 2018 where China stole US' Intellectual Property in the production of Semiconductors and in doind so, advances its own capabilities and infrastructure in the Production of Semiconductors. \
In modelling the impact of the Geopolitical Intervention on the Economy, two Simulations are created, each representing the Global Semiconductor Economy before and after the intervention. Through Data Analysis and Statistical tests, this project will assess the significance and magnitude of the Geopolitical Intervention on Global and Individual Regional Economies.

# Instructions
The full details of the project can be viewed in the 
[Simulation Report](/Simulation%20Report.pdf) file.  
  
For the Data Analysis of the Simulation, look into the [Semicon_Simulation](/Data%20Analysis/Semicon_Simulation.html) html file in the *Data Analysis* folder. The file contains the full report which documents the full methodology and results of the Data Analysis.  

The Simulation files are stored inside the folder *JaamSim Simulation*. The JaamSim Software is required to open the simulation and can be downloaded [here](https://jaamsim.com/downloads.html).  
The configuration source files [semiconductor_industry_past](/JaamSim%20Simulation/semiconductor_industry_past.cfg) and [semiconductor_industry_future](/JaamSim%20Simulation/semiconductor_industry_future.cfg) are the Past and Future Simulations respectively.  
To run the simulation, first download and extract the folder *JaamSim Simulation* folder.  
Right click on the *semiconductor_industry_past* or *semiconductor_industry_future* Simulation files, *open with* and select *JaamSim*.  
Alternative method is to open JaamSim, select *file, open*, then browse to downloaded folder and select the files 
*semiconductor_industry_past* or *semiconductor_industry_future*.  
As the Simulation has been preset to run at the maximum speed for data logging, you can adjust the speed by clicking "Real Time" then selecting the desired speed on the right.

# Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude my Academic Instructors, Prof Nuno and Prof Yue Mu for imparting the knowledge and skills sets for carrying out this Simulation Project in the course 40.015 Simulation Modelling and Analysis in SUTD. I would also like to express my greatest thanks to Prof Gordon for giving the inspiration of the US-China Semiconductor Trade War for the Simulation Project.

Lastly, I would like to thank my project Teammates Ryan, Sam and Haoron for all the contributions in the early stages of the project.
